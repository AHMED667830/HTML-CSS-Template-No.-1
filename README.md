## HTML CSS Web Project

This project was built with the grace of God.
It's dedicated to refining my programming skills. Many of my past projects were unplanned, just for fun or for other people. However, this is only my second serious project in my programming journey.


## File Contents Explained

* **Main Project File:** Our primary HTML file.
* **Style Folder:** This folder contains:
    * The main stylesheet.
    * `Normalize.css`, which helps improve website consistency.
